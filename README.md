# riskdata


An R package containing financial risk datasets relating to the four core areas of risk:

  * credit
  * market
  * liquidity
  * operational

```r
devtools::install_github("dandermotj/riskdata")
```

## Datasets

Datasets of this nature are hard to come by, mainly because they are proprietary or confidential. Most research in financial risk management is done in partnership with financial institutions so researchers can access real and relevant datasets. Unfortunately this leaves the literature mostly devoid of concrete examples. 

### Credit Risk 

  * Lending Club
  * Prosper
  * Home Credit

### Market Risk 

Just create a made up portfolio or set of portfolios?

### Operational Risk 

Maybe [this one](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset/data-related-to-operational-risk-2013) from the ECB data portal?

### Liquidity Risk 

Good luck...
